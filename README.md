# BrazMogu Font Repository

This is a repository of the fonts I've created for my own projects and which are available to be used about anywhere.

# Bitmap Fonts

These are fonts created for use with LÃ–VE2D's bitmap font API. They usually don't perform very well outside of their intended font size.

# TTF Fonts

These are TrueType fonts I've created for use in bigger projects. They are quite a pain to make, but look so good in comparison. :V
